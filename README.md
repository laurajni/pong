# Pong
My first game created in Unity: Pong  
Completed through following https://youtu.be/1oY--Zk9b6w  
I created my own main menu to allow for pausing and restarting once the game ended

Player 1 (right paddle) can use w and s to move up and down  
Player 2 (left paddle) use up and down arrow keys  

Hit escape to enter the menu / pause the game  
Currently the exit button in the menu doesn't do anything
